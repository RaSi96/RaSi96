Hello and welcome, visitor :)

- 👋 I'm a seasoned quant trader and data scientist.
- 👀 I’m professionally involved in roles that require applied ML research.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Embedded Systems Engineering, which is a side passion project of mine.
- 📚 I'm currently researching the practical nuances of complex-valued & physics-informed neural nets (CVNNs and PINNs).
- 🎓 I'm working towards earning my PhD in Computational Science and Engineering.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pragmatic applied AI research projects.
- 📫 You can reach out to me on here or via the links in my sidebar.

For obvious reasons, a lot of my work is proprietary and therefore will not be in publicly available repos. Maybe my **postgrad capstone** is why you came here, you can [find this in my `academia` repository over here](https://github.com/RaSi96/academia/tree/main/ml_projects/lab_worksheets/capstone). Note that it is split into two parts: the `.html` file is the analytical notebook, while the `.sql` file contains all data preprocessing. Both contain commentary.

I am available for consulting and collaborative research in the fields of applied ML, quant, and to some extent, data engineering.
