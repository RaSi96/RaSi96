Hello and welcome, visitor! :)

I am a seasoned quant trader/data scientist by profession. I like taking new, experimental methods in AI/quant finance and applying them to everyday problems. I also enjoy modelling things, programming simulations to play with, building computers and fiddling around with embedded systems (I do love my C programs). I'm interested in collaborating at the intersection of _actionable_ quant & AI: exploring techniques that actually solve a problem. For example, is bankruptcy an emergent phenomenon in a company's dynamic system, conditional on both endogenous (interally decided leverage & debt financing, or remuneration changes) and exogenous (clientele dynamics, or macro) forcings? Can we uncover such emergent phenomenon using ABM or other computational simulations and techniques? What about market/LOB/liquidity vortices?

Please feel free to approach me using the links in my sidebar, or on here directly (somehow). Note also that for obvious reasons, a lot of my work is proprietary and therefore might not be publicly available.
