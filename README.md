Hello and welcome, visitor :)

I am:
- 👋 A seasoned data scientist/quant.
- 👀 Professionally involved in industrial/applied ML research.
- 📚 Researching the the inner workings of neural nets, heavily inspired by [SETOL](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2507.17912).
- 🌱 Also a side data engineer/embedded systems engineer (I do love my C programs).
- 🎓 Working towards earning my MSc in Mathematical Finance.
- 💞️ Interested in collaborating with companies at the juncture of ESG data science+quant.
- 📫 Approachable via the links in my sidebar, or on here.

For obvious reasons, a lot of my work is proprietary and therefore will not be in publicly available repos. Peripheral code and/or publications/articles (data redacted) will be as much as possible, however.

❤️ Choose life. ❤️
